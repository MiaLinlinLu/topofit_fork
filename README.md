# TopoFit

TopoFit is a learning-based tool that rapidly fits a topologically-correct surface to the cerebral cortex in a brain MR image. Given an input image, this model can reconstruct a hemisphere in 0.6 seconds on a GPU and 8 seconds on a CPU. TopoFit will soon be released in the [FreeSurfer](https://freesurfer.net) neuroimaging software package.
